# `@with-gateways`

`@with-gateways` is a open source collection of [science gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_gateway) examples and resources maintained by the team at [Globus](https://www.globus.org/).

While many examples use the Globus platform as the research data management middleware, we aim to provide implementations and patterns applicable to any middleware focused on open science.
